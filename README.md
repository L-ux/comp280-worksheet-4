##### Extra notes
The code for my old radar system is still working in the backround, as the radar was the biggest change after my analysis. To make the old radar visible, Navigate the hierachy to \[ MainGameMenu >> Updatey Canvas >> Radar \] and then toggle its visibility back on. Repeat for \[ MainGameMenu >> Statics Canvas >> Radar ]
